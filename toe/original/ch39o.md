CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE: Analysis of Conditionality
The analysis of relations, or conditionality, is as important as the analysis of consciousness and the other aspects
of psycho-physical experience we have considered in the last
few chapters. This analysis has often been neglected in studies of the Abhidharma, which is paradoxical if you remember
that, of the seven books of the Abhidharma Pitaka, the Book of
Causal Relations (Patthana), which deals with conditionality, is
one of the largest. It is only by devoting sufficient attention to
the analysis of conditionality that we can avoid some of the pitfalls of an overly analytical view of reality. I alluded to this in
Chapter 32, when I devoted some time to examination and comparison of the analytical and the relational methods of investigation, which together make up the comprehensive approach of
Abhidharma philosophy.
Perhaps because the analytical approach of the Abhidharma
has received more attention than the relational, we find Abhidharma philosophy categorized as 'realistic pluralism' by some
scholars. This kind of categorization awakens all kinds of associations with movements of modern western philosophy, such
as positivism and the work of Bertrand Russell. It implies that
the result of Buddhist analysis is a universe in which numerous
individual, separate, and self-existing entities exist in their own
right and ultimately. While this may have been the view of some
early schools of Buddhism in India, it is certainly not the view of
mainstream Buddhism, udiether Theravada or Mahayana.
The only way we can avoid this pluralistic, fragmentary view
of reality is by taking due account of the relational approach outlined in the Patthana and also developed in the Compendium
ofRelations (Abhidhammattha Sangaha). By doing so, we Will
achieve a correct and balanced view of Buddhist philosophy, a
view that takes into account the static and analytical aspect of
experience as well as the dynamic and relational aspect.
The importance of understanding relations, or conditionality, is clearly indicated in the Buddha's own words. On a number
of occasions the Buddha specifically associated the understanding of conditionality, or interdependent origination, with the
attainment of liberation. He said that it is because of the failure
to understand interdependent origination that we have so long
wandered in this round of repeated rebirth.
The Buddha's enlightenment is frequently described as consisting of his penetrating the knowledge of interdependent origination. This very close connection between the knowledge of
interdependent origination and enlightenment is further illustrated by the fact that ignorance is most frequently defined, both
in the sutras and in the Abhidharma, as either ignorance of the
Four Noble Truths or ignorance of interdependent origination.
Now, the theme underlying both the Four Noble Truths and
interdependent origination is conditionality or causality, the
relation between cause and effect. Thus the knowledge of conditionality is equivalent to the destruction of ignorance and the
attainment of enlightenment.
The analysis of conditionality in the Abhidharma tradition
is treated under two headings: (1) the analysis of interdependent
origination, and (2) the analysis of the twenty-four conditions.
We will look at them separately and then together, to see how
they interact, support, and inform each other.
I will not explain each of the twelve components of interdependent origination here, since they are described in Chapter 10.
I would, however, like to briefly mention the three fundamental schemes of interpretation of the twelve components: (a) the
scheme that divides and distributes the twelve components over
the course of three lifetimes — past, present, and future; (b) the
scheme that divides the components into afflictions, actions, and
sufferings; and (c) the scheme that divides the components into
active (or causal) and reactive (or resultant) categories. In this
third scheme, ignorance, mental formation or volition, craving,
clinging, and becoming belong to the causal category and can
belong to either the past life or the present life, while consciousness, name and form, the six senses, contact, feeling, birth and
old age and death belong to the effect category and can belong to
either the present life or the future life. Thus there is an analysis
of cause and effect, or conditionality, in the formula of interdependent origination.
The twenty-four conditions are not mutually exclusive. Many
of them are partly or entirely identifiable with one another. The
only explanation for several instances of almost (if not completely) identical factors is the desire of the authors' to be absolutely comprehensive, so as to avoid the slightest possibility of
neglecting a mode of conditionality.
Let us look at each of the twenty-four conditions in turn:
(1) cause, (2) objective condition, (3) predominance, (4) contiguity, (5) immediacy, (6) simultaneous origination, (7) reciprocity, (8) support, (9) decisive support, (10) preexistence, (11) post-existence, (12) repetition, (13) karma, (14) effect, (15) nutriment,
(16) control, (17) absorption, (18) path, (19) association, (20) disassociation, (21) presence, (22) absence, (23) separation, and
(24) non-separation.
A distinction must be made between cause, or root cause,
and condition. We need to look at the Abhidharma literature
if we want to distinguish cause from condition, because in the
Sutra literature the two terms seem to be used interchangeably.
Generally, we can understand the distinction by recourse to an
analogy taken from the physical world: while the seed is the
cause of the sprout, factors like water, earth, and sunlight are the
conditions of the sprout. In the Abhidharmic treatment of conditionality, cause operates in the mental sphere and refers to the six
wholesome or unwholesome roots — non-greed, non-hatred, and
non-delusion and their opposites, greed, hatred, and delusion.
Objective condition refers generally to the object which conditions experience. For example, a visual object is the objective condition of visual consciousness. Predominance refers to
four categories of mental or volitional activities — wish, thought,
effort, and reason — which have an overriding influence on factors of experience.
Contiguity and immediacy are virtually synonymous and refer
to the conditioning of a thought-moment by the immediately
preceding thought-moment. Contiguity and immediacy also
refer to the conditioning of a given state of mind or matter by
the immediately preceding state of mind or matter. We can perhaps understand this better if we think of contiguity and immediacy in the sense of immediate proximity in time and space,
respectively.
Simultaneous origination can be seen in the case of the mental aggregates of consciousness, volition, perception, and feeling, and also in the case of the four essentials of matter (earth,
water, fire, and air). Reciprocity or mutuality refers to the mutual
dependence and support of factors, as in the case of the legs of a
tripod that depend on and support one another. Support means
the basis of any particular factor, in the way that the earth is the
support of trees or canvas is the support of a painting. But when
simple support becomes decisive support, it should be understood
in the sense of inducement in a particular direction. This will
become clearer when we examine how the twenty-four modes
of conditionality function in relation to the twelve components
of interdependent origination.
Preexistence or antecedence refers to the preexistence of factors
that continue to exist after subsequent factors come into being.
This is illustrated by the preexistence of the sense organs and
objects of the senses, which continue to exist and thereby condition subsequent physical and mental experience. Post-existence
complements preexistence and refers to the existence of subsequent factors such as mental and physical experience that condition preexisting factors like the sense organs and objects.
Repetition is important in the sphere of mental life and leads
to skill or familiarity. This is exemplified in the seven moments
of impulse consciousness (see Chapter 37). Repetition is particularly important in the sphere of wholesome and unwholesome
action because it increases the force of wholesome or unwholesome thought-moments.
Karma is volitional action of a wholesome or unwholesome
variety. Effect or result indicates that the reactive aspect of previous karma has an influence and serves to condition coexisting phenomena. It is interesting to note that even effects do, to
a limited extent, function as conditions or as causes. This will
become clear if we remember that we are considering the functional rather than the essentialistic definitions of such factors.
Nutriment refers to not only physical food, which is one
of the conditions of the physical body, but also to mental food,
such as impressions, which are the mental food of the aggregate of feeling. Control refers to confidence, mindfulness, and so
forth, which master or control their opposites. Absorption refers
not only to meditative absorption but also to absorption in a
more general sense, which encompasses both wholesome and
unwholesome absorptions. You may remember that the factors
of absorption (jhananga) are not necessarily wholesome and pertain not only to the states of meditative absorption but also to
a general condition of intensification of consciousness, whether
wholesome or unwholesome (see Chapter 34).
Path refers to the path leading to unhappy states encompassing wrong views, wrong effort, and so forth, and also to the
Noble Eightfold Path. Association refers to the conditioning of a
factor by a similar factor, whereas disassociation is the conditioning by a dissimilar factor, such as the way sweetness and bitterness, light and darkness condition each other. Thus conditionality is not only positive but also negative. In other words, a particular factor of experience is conditioned not only by factors that
are similar but also by factors that are dissimilar.
Presence refers to the necessary existence of certain conditions
in order that other phenomena occur. For instance, light must be
present for the experience of a visible form to arise. Absence is,
like disassociation, a negative form of conditionality. For example, the disappearance of light is a condition for the arising of
darkness. Separation and non — separation are identical to disassociation and association, respectively.
The twenty-four modes of conditionality operate in conjunction with the twelve components of interdependent origination.
For example, ignorance, the first of the twelve components, conditions volition, the second component, by way of two modes of
conditionality: objective condition and decisive support.
This can be understood as follows: Volition can be meritorious or demeritorious, and ignorance functions as the decisive
support of both. Ignorance functions as the decisive support
conditioning meritorious volition if it is made the object of your
meditation, in that the desire to free yourself from ignorance
induces you to practice meditation and so forth. Conversely, if
an unwholesome state of mind, such as greed (which is born of
ignorance), becomes the Object Of your absorption, then ignorance functions as the decisive support of demeritorious volition.
If you then commit an unwholesome action (steal a cookie, say),
it is because ignorance has functioned as a decisive supporting
condition inducing you to create the unwholesome volition on
which the unwholesome action was based. Ignorance can also
condition volition by way of contiguity, repetition, and so forth.
Volition (the second component of interdependent origination) conditions rebirth consciousness (the third component) by
means of karma and decisive support, while consciousness conditions name and form (the fourth component) through reciprocity and also by means of support. Thus each of the twelve
components conditions the subsequent component in a particular Away identifiable in terms of the twenty-four conditions. We
could cite more examples, but they would only reiterate how
these twenty-four modes of conditionality condition the twelve
components of interdependent origination.
The idea at the heart of the teaching of interdependent origination and the teaching of conditionality is the avoidance of
the two extremes, the erroneous views of eternalism and nihilism. The Buddha said that seeing the doer of an action and the
one who experiences the fruit of that action as identical is one
extreme, while seeing them as different is another extreme. He
taught the avoidance of these two extremes when he taught the
Middle Way, which emerges from an understanding of interdependent origination and conditionality.
If we examine the twelve factors of interdependent origination in the light of the twenty-four modes of conditionality, we
find that in all twelve factors there is no self, but only processes
conditioned by other processes — processes that are, in their
actual nature, empty of self and substance. This understanding
of the emptiness of self and substance is achieved through an
understanding of conditionality.
It is in this sense that the consciousness belonging to this
life and the consciousness belonging to the next life are neither identical nor different. When we understand the relationship between this life and the next — between the doer of an
action and the experiencer of an action — as one that cannot be
described in terms of either identity or difference, we arrive at
an understanding of the Middle Way.
The relationship between this life and the next is one of cause
and effect, and the relation of cause and effect is one of neither
identity nor difference. In this way we can successfully avoid
both the extreme of belief in an eternal self and the extreme of
rejection of the law of moral responsibility, or karma.
We can perhaps make this conditioned relationship between
cause and effect clearer by looking at examples from daily life.
Take the case of the seed and the sprout. The sprout originates
dependent on the seed, but the sprout and the seed are neither
identical nor different. They are obviously not identical, but by
the same token, neither are they altogether different. Similarly,
when a sound produces an echo, the two are not identical but
neither are they altogether different. In the same way, this life
and the next life are neither identical nor different; rather, the
next life arises dependent on this life, volition, and ignorance.
In this process of conditioned arising, there is no persistent,
permanent, and identical self, but neither is there an annihilation of the continuity of the process of cause and effect. If we
can understand the relation between cause (or condition) and
effect (or result) as a relation that cannot be described in terms
of identity and difference, permanence and annihilation, we will
understand emptiness, the Middle Way, and how not-self and
insubstantiality are compatible with moral responsibility and
rebirth.

CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE: Philosophy and Psychology in the Abhidharma
One of the functions of the Abhidharma is definition.
Definition is important because, to successfully communicate about a rather technical subject, we must know precisely
what our terms mean. Thus I would like to look at a number of
terms used frequently and popularly in speaking about Buddhist
thought. I would like to arrive at an understanding of the definitions of these terms and then relate them to the nature of the
teachings of the Buddha.
Buddhism has often been called a religion, a philosophy,
and, in recent years, a psychology. 'Religion' refers to belief in,
or recognition of, a higher, unseen power that controls the course
of the universe. Moreover, religion has an emotional and moral
component and has to do with rituals and worship. Because
Buddhism does not recognize the existence of such a power and
does not universally emphasize rituals and worship, it is difficult to categorize Buddhism in general — and particularly the
Abhidharma — as a religion.
In its original sense, 'philosophy' means the 'love of wisdom
and knowledge.' More generally, it means investigation of the
nature of the laws or causes of all being. This definition might
apply to Buddhism except that it remains somewhat vague, due
to the various meanings of the words 'nature' and 'being.' This
has led to two approaches in philosophical thinking, called metaphysics and phenomenology. Metaphysics is the study of absolute or first principles. It is also sometimes called the science of
ontology, which means the study of essences or, in simple terms,
the study of things in themselves. Phenomenology, in contrast,
is the description of things as they are experienced by the individual; it is the science of epistemology, the study of things as
they are known, as they appear to us. Insofar as Buddhism is
philosophical, it is concerned primarily with phenomenology.
'Psychology' is the study of the mind and mental states.
Like philosophy, it has two aspects — pure psychology, which is
the general study of mental phenomena, and psychotherapy, or
applied psychology, which is the application of the study of mental phenomena to the problem of disease and cure, disturbance
and adjustment. We might explain the difference between pure
and applied psychology by means of an analogy. Imagine that a
man climbs to the top of a hill and surveys the countryside without any particular purpose in mind. His survey will take in every
detail — the hills, the woods, the rivers and streams — without discrimination. But if he has a purpose in mind — for instance, if he
intends to reach another hilltop in the distance — then his survey will focus on the particular features that will help or hinder
him in his progress toward that goal. When we speak of applied
psychology or psychotherapy, we mean a study of the mind and
mental states that focuses on those phenomena that will help or
hinder one's progress toward mental well-being.
Having looked briefly at the definitions of religion, philosophy, and psychology, we can begin to see that the phenomenological aspect of philosophy and the therapeutic aspect of psychology
relate best to an understanding of the Buddha's teaching.
The Abhidharma, like Buddhist thought in general, is highly
rational and logical. If we look closely at the methods of exposition and argument in the Abhidharma, we find the beginning of
dialectics, which is the science of debate, and also the beginning
of logical argument and analysis. This is particularly evident in
the fourfold classification of the nature of questions. It is said
that familiarity with and ability to use this classification is indispensable for anyone who wants to engage fruitfully in discussion
and debate about the Dharma, because to answer a question correctly, one has to understand the nature of the question.
The first class of questions is the most direct and refers to
those that can be answered directly and categorically, such as
'Do all living beings die?' To this the answer is 'Yes, all living
beings die.'
The second class can only be answered with qualifications,
for instance, 'Will all living beings be reborn?' This kind of
question cannot be answered directly and categorically because
it has two possible interpretations. Thus it must be analyzed and
answered individually, taking into account each of the possible
meanings: 'Living beings who are not free from the afflictions
will be reborn, but those who are free from the afflictions, like
the Arhats, will not be reborn.'
The third class of questions must be answered with counterquestions, as, for instance, 'Is man powerful?' Here the reference
point of the question must be determined before the question
can be answered: in other words, is man powerful with reference
to the gods or to animals? If the former, then man is not powerful; if the latter, then man is powerful. The aim of the counter-question is to determine the reference point that the questioner has in mind.
The fourth class of questions are those in which we are particularly interested here. These are questions that do not deserve
an answer; the famous inexpressible propositions to which the
Buddha remained silent fall into this category. Traditionally,
there are fourteen unanswerable questions. We find them, for
instance, in the Chulamalunkya Suita. These fourteen questions
are grouped into three categories:
The first category contains eight questions that concern the
absolute or final nature of the world: Is the world eternal or not
eternal, or both or neither; finite or not finite, or both or neither? You can see that this category includes two sets of questions, and that both sets refer to the world. The first set refers to
the existence of the world in time, and the second to the existence of the world in space.
The second category contains four questions: Does the
Tathagata exist after death or not, or both or neither? These questions refer to the nature of nirvana, or ultimate reality.
The third category contains two questions: Is the self identical with or different from the body? While the first category of
questions refers to the world and the second to what is beyond
the world, this last refers to personal experience. Do we die with
our bodies, or are our personalities altogether different from and
independent of our bodies?
The Buddha remained silent when asked these fourteen questions. He described them as a net and refused to be drawn into
such a net of theories, speculations, and dogmas. He said that it
was because he was free of the bondage of all theories and dogmas that he had attained liberation. Such speculations, he said,
are attended by fever, unease, bewilderment, and suffering, and
it is by freeing oneself of them that one achieves liberation.
Let us look at the fourteen questions in general to see whether
we can understand why the Buddha took this stand. Generally,
the fourteen questions imply two basic attitudes toward the
world. The Buddha spoke of these two attitudes in his dialogue
with Maha Kachchayana, when he said that there are two basic
views, the view of existence and the view of nonexistence. He
said that people are accustomed to think in these terms, and that
as long as they remain entangled in these two views they will
not attain liberation. The propositions that the world is eternal,
that the world is infinite, that the Tathagatha exists after death,
and that the self is independent of the body reflect the view of
existence. The propositions that the world is not eternal, that the
world is finite, that the Tathagata does not exist after death, and
that the self is identical with the body reflect the view of nonexistence.
These two views were professed by teachers of other schools
during the time of the Buddha. The view of existence is generally the view of the Brahmins; that of nonexistence is generally
the view of the materialists and hedonists. When the Buddha
refused to be drawn into the net of these dogmatic views of existence and nonexistence, I think he had two things in mind: (1) the
ethical consequences of these two views, and, more importantly,
(2) the fact that the views of absolute existence and nonexistence
do not correspond to the way things really
For example, the eternalists view this self as permanent and
unchanging. When the body dies, this self will not die because
the self is by nature unchanging. If that is the case, it does not
matter what this body does: actions of the body will not affect
the destiny of the self. This view is incompatible with moral
responsibility because if the self is eternal and unchanging, it
will not be affected by wholesome and unwholesome actions.
Similarly, if the self were identical with the body and the self
dies along with the body, then it does not matter what the body
does. If you believe that existence ends at death, there will be
no constraint upon action. But in a situation where things exist
through interdependent origination, absolute existence and nonexistence are impossible.
Another example drawn from the fourteen unanswerable
questions also shows that the propositions do not correspond to
the M,nay things really are. Take the example of the world. The
world does not exist absolutely or not exist absolutely in time.
The world exists dependent on causes and conditions — ignorance,
craving, and clinging. When ignorance, craving, and clinging
are present, the world exists; when they are not present, the
world ceases to exist. Hence the question of the absolute existence or nonexistence of the world is unanswerable.
The same may be said of the other categories of questions that
make up the fourteen unanswerables. Existence and nonexistence, taken as absolute ideas, do not apply to things as they really
are. This is why the Buddha refused to agree to absolute statements about the nature of things. He saw that the absolute categories of metaphysics do not apply to things as they really are.
As for the Buddha's attitude toward psychology, there is
no doubt that he placed a great deal of emphasis on the role
of the mind. We are familiar with the famous verses in the
Dhammapada where the Buddha speaks of the mind as the forerunner of all mental states. The text says that happiness and suffering result from acting with a pure mind and an impure mind,
respectively. We need only look at the canonical texts to recognize the importance of mind in Buddhist teachings. There we
find the five aggregates, four out of five of which are mental, and
the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment, the majority of which
are mental. No matter where we look, we will be struck by the
importance of mind in the teachings of the Buddha.
Various religions and philosophies have their particular
starting points. The theistic religions begin with God. Ethical
teachings like Confucianism begin with man as a social entity.
Buddhism begins with the mind. It is therefore not surprising that we often choose to describe the Buddha's teaching as
a psychological one, and that we also describe it as psychotherapy, since the symbolism of disease and cure is prominent in the
teaching of the Buddha. The Four Noble Truths are a reflection
of the ancient scheme of disease, diagnosis, cure, and treatment
used in early medical science, and we might also recall that the
Buddha was called the king of physicians.
The Buddha was interested in cure, not in metaphysical categories. We find his use of various techniques of cure throughout the discourses in the Sutra Pitaka. For instance, take the
Buddha's teaching about the self. In the Dhammapada the
Buddha taught that the wise man can attain happiness by disciplining himself, and yet in other places in the discourses, we
find the Buddha expounding the doctrine of not-self, the idea
that nowhere in the psycho-physical components of experience
is the permanent self to be found.
For the explanation of this apparent contradiction, we need
to look at the Buddha's dialogue with Vachchhagotta, who
asked the Buddha whether or not the self existed. The Buddha
remained silent, and after a time Vachchhagotta left. Ananda,
who happened to be nearby, asked the Buddha why he had not
replied. The Buddha explained that if he had said that the self
existed, he would have been siding with those Brahmins who
believed in the absolute existence of the self, but if he had told
Vachchhagotta that the self did not exist, it would have been confusing for Vachchhagotta, who would have thought, 'Previously
I had a self, but now I no longer have one.' The Buddha chose
to remain silent because he knew Vachchhagotta's predicament. Similarly, when confronted by those who did not believe
in rebirth, he taught the existence of the self, whereas to those
who believed in the reality of karma, in the fruit of good and bad
actions, he taught the doctrine of not-self. This is the Buddha's
skill in the means of instruction.
We can see how this ties in with the Buddha's rejection of
absolute categories when we look at his use of the symbol of the
water-snake. Here we find the Buddha saying that the factors of
experience are similar to a water-snake. When a person capable
of handling a water-snake and knowledgeable in the method of
capturing one attempts to catch one, he will do so successfully.
But when a person unaccustomed to handling a water-snake and
ignorant of how to capture one attempts it, his attempt will end
in lamentation and pain. Similarly, phenomena — the factors of
experience — are nothing in themselves. They are not absolutely
existent or absolutely nonexistent, neither absolutely good nor
absolutely bad; rather, they are relative. Whether they result in
happiness or pain, in progress along the path or in retrogresSion, depends not on the phenomena themselves but on how we
handle them.
If things are handled in the right way, through a conscious
and deliberate adjustment of the mind, phenomena can be used
for one's progress along the path. A knife, for instance, is neither
true nor false, yet someone who grasps it by the blade is surely in
error. When we relate to phenomena in terms of craving, ill-will,
and ignorance, this results in suffering. When we take them otherwise, this results in happiness.
To summarize, we can use terms like 'philosophy' and 'psychology' in relation to the Buddhist tradition as long as we
remember that we are interested in philosophy not as it concerns essences and absolute categories but as a description of
phenomena, and that we are interested in psychology insofar
as it concerns psychotherapy. These qualities of the philosophy
and psychology of the Abhidharma are unique in the history of
human thought. Nowhere else, in the ancient or modern world,
in Asia or the West, has such a phenomenology and psychotherapy evolved.
What is unique about Buddhist phenomenology and psychotherapy is its rejection of the idea of a permanent self and its
affirmation of the possibility of liberation. In all other systems,
even those of western philosophical phenomenology and psychotherapy, we find an inability to reject the idea of a permanent
self — the very rejection so characteristic of the teaching of the
Buddha and of the Abhidharma. And nowhere within modern
psychology do we find that possibility of ultimate and absolute
freedom so central to the teachings of Buddhism.

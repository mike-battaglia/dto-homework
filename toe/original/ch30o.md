Part Four: The Abhidharma

CHAPTER THIRTY: Introduction to the Abhidharma
In Chapters 30 through 41, I will discuss the philosophical
and psychological aspects of Buddhism presented in the seven
books of the Abhidharma Pitaka of the Pali canon.
I will not look in great detail at the lists of factors, or dharmas, found in many competent books on the Abhidharma.
Instead, my objectives here are three: (1) to outline and describe
the principal methods and characteristics of the Abhidharma,
(2) to relate the Abhidharma to what we generally know about
the teachings of the Buddha, and (3) to relate Abhidharma philosophy to our situation as lay Buddhists.
Throughout the history of Buddhism, the Abhidharma has
been held in high esteem. In the books of the Pali canon, for
example, the Abhidharma is spoken of in terms of praise and speCial regard. There the Abhidharma is the special domain of the
elder monks; novices are even asked not to interrupt the Elders
when they are engaged in a discussion of the Abhidharma. We
also find the Abhidharma recommended only for those who sincerely strive to realize the goal of Buddhist practice, and that a
knowledge of it is recommended for teachers of the Dharma.
This traditional regard for the Abhidharma is found not
only in the Theravada tradition but in other major Buddhist
traditions as well. For instance, Kumarajiva, the great Central
Asian translator renowned for his translation of Madhyamaka
works into Chinese, is said to have firmly believed that he must
introduce the Abhidharma to the Chinese if he wished to teach
them Buddhist philosophy. In the Tibetan tradition, also, the
Abhidharma is an important part of monastic training.
Why is the Abhidharma held in such high esteem? The basic
reason is that a knowledge of the Abhidharma, in the general
sense of understanding the ultimate teaching, is absolutely necessary to achieve wisdom, which is in turn necessary to achieve
freedom. No matter how long one meditates or how virtuous a
life one leads, without insight into the real nature of things, one
cannot achieve freedom.
A knowledge of the Abhidharma is necessary in order to
apply the insight into impermanence, impersonality, and insubstantiality that we gain from a reading of the Sutra Pitaka to
every experience of daily life. All of us may glimpse impermanence, impersonality, and insubstantiality through reading the Sutra Pitaka, but how often can we apply that momentary intellectual truth to our daily existence? The system in the
Abhidharma teaching provides a mechanism for doing so. A
study of the Abhidharma is therefore extremely useful for our
practice.
Let us consider the origin and authenticity of the Abhidharma.
The Theravada school holds that the Buddha is the source of the
Abhidharma philosophy and was himself the first master of the
Abhidharma because, on the night of his enlightenment, he penetrated the essence of the Abhidharma. According to a traditional
account, the Buddha also spent the fourth week after his enlightenment in meditation on the Abhidharma. This is the week
known as 'the House of Gems.' Later in his career, it is said that
the Buddha visited the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, where his
mother was, and taught the Abhidharma to her and the gods. It
is said that when he returned to earth, he passed on the essentials
of what he had taught to Sariputta â€” hardly a coincidence, since
Sariputta was his foremost disciple, renowned for his wisdom.
Thus it is claimed in general that it is the Buddha to whom
we owe the inspiration of the Abhidharma teaching. This inspiration was passed on to his disciples who were philosophically
gifted, like Sariputta, and by the effort of these gifted disciples the general outline and contents of Abhidharma philosophy were established.
Let us go on to consider the meaning of the term abhidharma. If we look carefully at the Sutra Pitaka, we find this term
occurring frequently, usually in the general sense of 'meditation
about Dharma,' 'instruction about Dharma,' or 'discussion about
Dharma.' In a more specific sense, abhidharma means 'special
Dharma,' 'higher Dharma,' or 'further Dharma.' Here, of course,
we are using Dharma in the sense of doctrine or teaching, not in
the sense of phenomenon or factor of experience (in which case
it would not be capitalized).
There is an even more technical sense in which the term
abhidharma is used in the Sutra Pitaka, and in this context
dharma no longer means doctrine in general but, rather, phenomenon. This technical use is associated with another function,
that is to make distinctions. The most technical use of the term
abhidharma has five aspects, or meanings: (a) to define dharmas;
(b) to ascertain the relationship between dharmas; (c) to analyze
dharmas; (d) to classify dharmas, and (e) to arrange dharmas in
numerical order.
The Buddhist canon is divided into three collections (literally, 'baskets'): the Sutra Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the
Abhidharma Pitaka. The Sutra Pitaka is ordinarily termed the
basket of the discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the rules
covering the monastic community, and the Abhidharma Pitaka
is normally referred to as the books of Buddhist philosophy and
psychology. Here I would like to look at the relationship between
the Abhidharma Pitaka and the Sutra Pitaka. There is a great deal
of Abhidharmic material in the Sutra Pitaka. Remember the
technical definition of abhidharma that we considered a moment
ago. Keeping that in mind, we find in the Sutra Pitaka a number
of discourses that are Abhidharmic in character: the Anguttara
Nikaya, which presents an exposition of teachings arranged in
numerical order; the Sangiti Sutta and Dasuttara Sutta, in which
Sariputta expounds on items of the teachings arranged
in numerical order; and the Anupada Sutta, a discourse in which Sariputta
analyzes his meditative experience in Abhidharmic terms.
How, then, can we arrive at a distinction between the
Abhidharma and the sutras? To do this we need to look at the
second meaning of the term abhidharma, namely, its use in the
sense of 'higher doctrine.' In the sutras the Buddha speaks from
two points of view. First he speaks of beings, objects, the qualities and possessions of beings, the world, and the like, and he
is often found making statements such as 'l myself will go to
Uruvela.' Second, the Buddha proclaims in no uncertain terms
that there is no 'l' and that all things are devoid of personality,
substance, and so forth.
Obviously, the two standpoints in operation here are the
conventional (vohara) and the ultimate (paramattha). We have
everyday language like 'you' and 'l,' and we also have technical
philosophical language that does not assume personality, objects,
and so forth. This is the difference between the Sutric contents
and the Abhidharmic contents of the teachings of the Buddha.
By and large, the sutras use the conventional standpoint while
the Abhidharma uses the ultimate standpoint. Yet there are passages in the sutras that describe impermanence, impersonality
or insubstantiality, elements, and aggregates, and hence reflect
the ultimate standpoint. In this context there is also a division of
texts into those whose meaning is explicit and direct, and those
whose meaning is implicit and indirect.
Why did the Buddha resort to these two standpoints, the
conventional and the ultimate? For the answer we need to look
at his excellence as a teacher and skill in choosing methods of
teaching. If the Buddha had spoken to all his audiences only in
terms of impermanence, insubstantiality, elements, and aggregates, I do not think the Buddhist community would have grown
as quickly as it did during the sixth century BCE. At the same
time, the Buddha knew that the ultimate standpoint is indispensable for a profound understanding of the Dharma, so his
teachings do contain specific language for expressing the ultimate standpoint.

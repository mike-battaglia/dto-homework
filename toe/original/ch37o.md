CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN: Analysis of Thought-Processes
In this chapter we will begin to see, in a more specific and
direct way, how the analysis of consciousness and the analysis
of mental states can really contribute to the awakening of insight,
and how such analysis can also be interpreted in our daily life to
change our understanding of our situation.
Why analyze the processes of thought or the processes of
perception? To answer this, we need to remind ourselves of the
general purpose of the Abhidharma —  namely, to facilitate our
understanding of the ultimate nature of things, which share the
three universal characteristics of impermanence, suffering, and
not-self. In the analysis of thought-processes, we can see impermanence and not-self clearly revealed, as two analogies from the
discourses of the Buddha show.
The Buddha likened the life span of a living being to a single point on the wheel of a chariot. He said that, strictly speaking, a living being only endures for the time it takes one thought
to arise and perish, just as the chariot wheel, whether rolling or
at rest, makes contact with the ground at only a single point. In
this context, the past moment existed but it does not exist now,
nor will it exist in the future; the present moment exists now
but did not exist in the past, nor will it exist in the future; and
the future moment, although it will exist in the future, does not
exist now, nor did it exist in the past.
The Buddha also referred to the case of a king who had never
heard the sound of a lute. When he did hear one, the king asked
his ministers what it was that was so enchanting and enthralling. His ministers replied that it was the sound of a lute. The
king asked for the lute; when his ministers brought one, he asked
them where the sound was. When the ministers explained that
the sound was produced by a combination of diverse factors, the
king said that the lute was a poor thing indeed, broke it up with
his own hands, and had the pieces burned and their ashes scattered. What the ministers called the sound of a lute, the king
said, was nowhere to be found. Similarly, nowhere among the
physical and mental factors of experience — among factors of
form, feeling, perception, volition, and consciousness —  is there a
self to be found. Thought-processes are, like the sound of a lute,
also devoid of self.
The analysis of thought-processes also has a very specific
application in the area of mental development, in the mastery and control of objects of the senses. You may recall that we
spoke earlier about the sensitivity of the mind to the objects of
the senses, and said that the mind is constantly subject to distractions that arise because of contact with sights, sounds, smells,
tastes, and tactile sensations. The Buddha himself declared that
one is either conquered by sense objects or conquers them: in
other words, one is either controlled by and subject to sense
stimuli or manages and dominates sense stimuli. This is why
Nagarjuna once said that even an animal can be victorious in
battle, whereas he who is able to conquer the momentary, ever changing objects of the senses is the true hero.
When someone subdues, masters, and controls the objects of
the senses, we call him heedful. Heedfulness is akin to mindfulness, which the Buddha said is the one way to freedom.
Heedlessness is the source of death and of bondage in samsara,
while heedfulness is the source of the deathless, or nirvana. Those
who were formerly heedless and later become heedful, like Nanda
and Angulimala, are able to achieve the goal of freedom.
By analyzing and understanding how the objects of the
senses are perceived and assimilated by consciousness, we can
pave the way toward right understanding in terms of impermanence and not-self, and toward control over the momentary
objects of the senses. Finally, we can achieve heedfulness, which
is the key to changing our existence from one dominated by the
afflictions to one that is purified and noble.
We can begin our analysis of thought-processes by examining their place in our experience. Take the comparison of life
to a river, with a source and an outlet. Between birth and death,
between the source of the river and its mouth, there is a continuum but not an identity. In Abhidharmic terms, birth or rebirth
is the 'uniting' or 'connecting' factor (patisandht), the life continuum is the 'subconscious' factor (bhavanga), and death is the
'falling away' factor (chutt). These three factors have one thing in
common: their object is the last conscious factor of the preceding life. This object determines them as wholesome or unwholesome resultant factors of consciousness.
In this context, it is important to remember that bhavanga
runs concurrent with the reproductive karma that gives a particular life its general characteristics and sustains it until it is either
interrupted or exhausted. Thus the past, present, and future of
an individual life are united not only consciously, by the continuum of patisandhi, bhavanga, and chuti, but also subconsciously,
by bhavanga alone. This subconscious factor of life continuum
preserves continuity and sustains life even in the absence of conscious thought-processes, as in dreamless sleep and moments of
unconsciousness like coma. In between the various conscious
thought-processes, bhavanga reasserts itself and preserves the
continuity of life.
To summarize, our life begins with the uniting or connecting conscious factor (patisandhi) that joins the previous life to
this life. It is sustained throughout the course of this life by the
subconscious factor of life continuum (bhavanga), and it ends
with the falling away (chuti) that again precedes union (in the
form of patisandhi with the subsequent life.
Consciousness, as opposed to subconsciousness (bhavanga),
arises as a phenomenon of resistance and vibration. In other
words, bhavanga remains subconscious until it is interrupted or
obstructed by an object, as when we place a dam across a river
and find that the course of the river is interrupted, or subject an
electrical current to resistance and find that the phenomenon of
light arises. This contact between bhavanga and an object results
in resistance, and this resistance results in vibration, which in
turn results in a conscious thought-process.
The thought-processes that arise as a result of this interruption
are either (1) physical thought-processes that operate through the
five sense doors (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body), or (2) mental thought-processes that operate through the mind, the sixth
sense organ. Physical thought-processes are determined by the
intensity, or impact, of the object that brings about the interruption of the stream of life continuum. In this sense, the largest obstruction will cause the longest thought-process, and the
smallest obstruction will cause the shortest thought-process.
There are four types of physical thought-processes, from one
that runs for seventeen thought-moments to one that fails even
to reach the point of determination or identification of the object.
There are two types of mental thought-processes: (1) one termed
'clear,' which runs through to retention, the final stage of thought processes, and (2) one termed 'obscure,' which ends before the
stage of retention. Depending on the intensity of the obstruction
in the subconscious stream of life continuum, we have a more
intensive and lengthier thought-process or a less intensive and
briefer one.
Let us look at the seventeen thought-moments that make up
the longest of any of the thought-processes, physical or mental.
Remember that each of these thought-moments is said to last
less than one billionth the time it takes to wink an eye. Thus
when the Buddha said that a living being endures only as long
as a single thought-moment, he was talking about an extremely
brief period of time.
The first of these seventeen thought-moments is termed
'entry' and refers to an object impinging upon the stream of life
continuum, or the placing of an object of obstruction in the river
of life.
The second moment is termed 'vibrating' because the entry of
the object into the stream of life continuum sets up a vibration.
The third is the 'arresting' moment because at this point the
obstruction interrupts or arrests, the stream of life continuum.
Here we might ask how is it that the stream of life continuum (bhavanga), which has its own object that forms the basis
of the factor of unification (patisandhi) and the factor of decay
(chum, comes to have a secondary object in the form of a material object of the senses. This is explained by means of an analogy.
Buddhaghosa said that, just as tapping one grain of sugar among
many scattered on the surface of a drum causes a vibration that
affects a fly sitting on another grain of sugar on the drum, so
material objects of the five physical senses impinge upon and set
up vibrations that affect bhavanga.
Once these three moments  — entry, vibration, and interruption or arresting — have taken place, the object enters the conscious sphere. It does this through the fourth thought-moment,
which is the moment of the 'adverting consciousness.' In the case
of the physical thought-processes, the adverting consciousness
can be of five types — eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body.
This is succeeded by the fifth moment, the 'perceiving consciousness,' which can be of the five types — eye consciousness,
ear consciousness, and so forth.
This is followed by the sixth moment, the 'receiving consciousness'; the seventh moment, the 'investigating consciousness'; and the eighth moment, the 'determining consciousness.'
It is the determining consciousness that identifies and recognizes
the object of perception.
This determining consciousness is followed by seven
moments of 'impulse consciousness' (javana), which have the
function of running through the object, thereby assimilating the
object wholly into consciousness.
These ninth through fifteenth thought-moments are followed by two moments of resultant, retentive consciousness,
for seventeen thought-moments in all. The seven moments of
impulse consciousness are karmically active and can be wholesome or unwholesome. The moments of resultant, retentive consciousness, too, are either wholesome or unwholesome.
For the purpose of practice of the path, it is important to
know at which point in these seventeen thought-moments one
is able to act freely, for better or for worse. The three moments
of bhavanga are resultant. The adverting consciousness and the
determining consciousness are functional. The perceiving consciousness is resultant. Thus the seven moments of impulse
consciousness (javana) are the first karmically active thought moments. The first of these seven moments determines the next
six, so if it is wholesome, the rest are wholesome, and if it is
unwholesome, the rest are unwholesome, too.
It is at the point when determining consciousness is followed by the seven impulse moments that resultant or functional states give way to active states. This is the all-important
point in thought-processes, because one cannot alter the character of resultant or functional states but can alter the character
of active states, which have a wholesome or unwholesome karmic potential. At the moment when the javana moments commence, the presence or absence of wise attention is therefore very
important. If wise attention is present, the probability of wholesome impulses is greater; if absent, unwholesome impulses are
more likely to predominate.
The actual object of the seventeen thought-moments is of little importance here because the object in itself, no matter how
desirable or undesirable, does not determine whether the seven
impulse moments are wholesome or unwholesome. You may
recall the case of the Elder Tissa (sce Chapter 23). It happened
that the daughter-in-law of a certain family, having quarreled
with her husband, dressed in her best garments and jewelry and
set out to return to her father's house. When she came upon
the Elder Tissa, being of an irreverent nature, she let out a loud
laugh. Seeing her teeth, Tissa reacted in terms of the perception
of the foulness of the body, and by the strength of that perception won through to Arhatship on the spot. When the woman's
husband came along and asked whether Tissa had seen a woman
going that way, the Arhat replied that he was not aware whether
it had been a man or woman but knew that he had seen a heap
of bones walking along the road.
This story indicates that no matter what the nature of the
determining consciousness, the seven moments of impulse consciousness can be an occasion for either winning through to the
stage of Arhatship or for the further accumulation of moments
of consciousness that have an unwholesome karmic value. To a
man other than Tissa, the sight of the woman laughing might
have given rise to impulses rooted in lust rather than ones leading
to the realization of Arhatship. Since wise attention or the lack
of it determines the karmic value of the impulse moments that
follow, we need to apply wise attention to decrease the chances
of unwholesome impulses arising and increase the chances of
wholesome moments of impulse consciousness.
I would like to conclude by referring to a simile popularized
by Buddhaghosa in his Path of Purification (Visuddhi Magga) to
illustrate the seventeen moments of consciousness in a thought process. Suppose a man has gone to sleep at the foot of a mango
tree full of ripened fruit. A ripened mango is loosened from a
branch and falls to the ground. The sound of the mango falling to the ground stimulates the ears of the sleeping man, who
awakes, opens his eyes, and sees the fruit lying not far from
where he is. He stretches out his arm and takes the mango in his
hand. He squeezes the mango, smells it, and then eats it.
This whole process illustrates the seventeen moments of perceiving a physical object. The sound of the falling mango impinging upon the man's ears is analogous to the three moments of
bhavanga — entry, vibration, and interruption. When the man
uses his eyes and spots the mango, this is analogous to the
moments of adverting and perception; when he stretches out
his hand to take the fruit, to the moment of receiving; when he
squeezes the mango, to the moment of investigating; when he
smells it, to the moment of determining; when he eats it and
enjoys it, to the seven moments of impulse consciousness; and
(although apparently Buddhaghosa did not do this) one might
add that when he digests it, this is analogous to the two resultant moments of retention.
If we analyze our thought-processes carefully, and if through
heedfulness we master them, this can result in a deepened understanding of the ultimate nature of things as impermanent and
not-self. This analysis can also lead to mastery over the objects
of the senses, the result of which is dispassion, joy, and freedom.
We should therefore apply the knowledge we gain about the
momentary, conditioned, and transient nature of the processes of
thought and perception to our daily experience, in order to seek
out that understanding and wise attention which will enable us
to multiply our moments of wholesome karmic potential and
minimize our moments of unwholesome karmic potential. If we
can do this, we will have taken a very important step in extending our study of the Abhidharma from the merely intellectual
sphere to the practical and experiential sphere.

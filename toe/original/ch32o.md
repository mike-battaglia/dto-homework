CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO: Methodology
In this chapter I will discuss the methods through which the
Abhidharma investigates our personalities and our relations to
the world around us.
There are two ways to depict a given person and his relation
to the world around him: deductively and inductively. The rational or deductive method begins with an abstract idea and applies
that idea to one's experience. The empirical or inductive method
begins with the facts we encounter in experience; through
observing and analyzing, interpreting and understanding these
facts, we build up a picture of ourselves and the world around
us. In short, the rational method begins with the abstract and
tries to apply it to the concrete, whereas the inductive method
begins with the concrete and builds up a picture of reality gradually and progressively.
The inductive method, which is the one used in the
Abhidharmic system, is quite close to the method of science,
except that in science the focus of the inductive process is outward and in the Abhidharmic system the focus is inward, on the
mind. This is why the Abhidharmic method is sometimes called
introspection or, to use a traditional term, meditation.
When we say that the Abhidharmic method is empirical
and inductive, we mean that it has to do primarily with mental experience. Sometimes we say that meditation is like internal or mental microscopy: it is a way of investigating very closely
the facts of experience. The Abhidharmic method of introspection yields results because it manages, through meditation, to
slow down mental processes to a point where we can see and
understand them. In this respect there is a remarkable parallel
between the Abhidharmic method and the scientific method.
In science, when we want to find out how a certain transformation actually takes place, we slow down the process or speed it
up. In Abhidharmic meditation, too, we can slow down mental processes so that we can see what is actually happening, or
we can speed things up. If we could see our human life, from
birth to death, within the space of five minutes, it would give
us great insight into the nature of life. However, because this is
usually not possible, we slow things down. This is the basis of
Abhidharmic meditation.
The lists of mental factors and the like in the books of the
Abhidharma may appear tedious and speculative at first glance,
but in fact they are just the written form of the data we find
in this very careful investigation of experience. Far from being
speculative, the Abhidharma is the result of careful and close
introspective analysis of experience. That said, you may question the use of studying the Abhidharma at all, thinking that
it is surely more useful to sit in meditation and reproduce the
Abhidharmic experience of reality in one's own meditation. This
is true to the extent that, as in all aspects of Buddhist teaching,
direct as well as indirect acquaintance is required.
With the Abhidharmic view of the elements, the picture we
get when we analyze experience is certainly much more effective if it is a direct picture achieved through our own meditation.
But even if it is an indirect picture gained through study, it is
still of use to us, because when we sit down to meditate we will
already have some intellectual acquaintance with the general
outline of the picture we are trying to bring into focus. In this
sense studying the Abhidharma can be useful in bringing about
an indirect understanding of ourselves and the world around us
in Abhidharmic terms.
There are two ways Abhidharmic investigation works:
(1) through analysis, and (2) through synthesis, or relation.
The basic structure of these two methods is given in the first
and last books Of the Abhidharma Pitaka, the Dhammasangani
(Classification Of Factors) and the Patthana (Book Of Causal
Relations), respectively. These are the two most important
books of the Abhidharma. It is through the analytical method
and the synthetic or relational method that the Abhidharma
arrives at a basic understanding of not-self and emptiness.
Let us look first at the analytical method and then at the
relational method; finally, we will combine the two, as, indeed,
we must to reap the full benefit of the Abhidharmic method of
investigation. In The Questions ofKing Milinda (Milinda Panha),
it is said that the Buddha has accomplished a very difficult
task: 'If a man,' Nagasena says in reply to King Milinda, 'were
to take a boat out to the sea, and if he were to take a handful
of sea water and were then able to tell you that in it this much
water is from the Ganges, this much from the Yamuna, and
this much from the other great rivers of India, this would certainly be a very difficult thing to accomplish. In the same way,
the Buddha has analyzed a single conscious moment of experience — for instance, the experience of seeing a form —  into its various component parts: matter, feeling, perception, volition, and
consciousness.
Analysis is the dissection of an apparently unitary, homogeneous whole into its component parts. This analysis can be
applied not only to the self, as we find in the analysis of personal experience, but also to external objects: just as we can
break down the personality into the five aggregates, so we can
break down external phenomena into their component parts. For
example, we can break down a table into its legs, its top, and so
forth, and, even further, into the molecules and atoms of various elements that compose the table.
The purpose of dissecting an apparent whole is to uproot
attachment to internal and external phenomena. Once we recognize that this apparently homogeneous self is really just a collection of components, our attachment to the notion of the self
is weakened; similarly, once we realize that external phenomena are just collections of individual smaller components, our
attachment to external objects is weakened. What do we have
as a result of our analytical process? Internally, we are left with
moments of consciousness; externally, we are left with atoms. If
we consider the two together, we are left with elements, or factors of experience.
The mental and material elements of experience do not in
themselves bring us to the ultimate understanding of reality
because we are left with moments of consciousness and atoms
of matter — elements of experience. These elements remain irreducible no matter how long and how far we go in our process of
dissection. Although we come up with smaller and smaller parts,
we are left with a picture of reality that is broken up into little
bits and pieces as a result of dissection. This in itself is not an
accurate and complete picture of reality.
To arrive at the ultimate picture of reality, we need to couple
the analytical approach with the synthetic or relational approach.
That is why a great Buddhist scholar and saint, Nagarjuna, once
expressed his reverence for the Buddha as 'the teacher of interdependent origination.' The truth of interdependent origination
pacifies and calms the agitation of thought-construction. This is
an indication of the importance of relation, interdependence, or
conditionality in understanding the real nature of things. It is
also why scholars have focused on the Book of Causal Relations,
which supplies the other half of the Abhidharmic method of
investigation.
Just as, through analysis, we arrive at the insubstantiality of
personality and phenomena (because we see that they are made
up of component parts), so, through the process of relational
investigation, we arrive at the emptiness of personality and phenomena (because we see that the component parts which constitute them are all conditioned by and relative to each other). We
arrive at this insubstantiality and emptiness by focusing on the
teaching of interdependent origination.
We can see how, within a given thing — be it the personality or an external object — the component parts depend on one
another for their existence. For instance, within a single phenomenon, such as an apparently unitary table, there are several
component parts (the legs, the top, and so forth) that depend
on each other for their existence as part of a table. Similarly, the
table depends on its antecedent causes (the wood, the iron, and
action of the craftsman who put it together) and also on proximate conditions (like the floor on which it stands).
We can also explore the idea of interdependence in relation
to three dimensions: time, space, and karma. For instance, the
table is dependent in terms of time in the sense that, prior to the
table existing, a series of events occurred — the cutting of lumber, the construction of the table, and so forth. Ibis sequence of
events led to the arising of the table. Similarly, the table is dependent in terms of space in the sense that it stands on the floor, and
so forth. The third dimension of conditionality operates beyond
time and space. "This dimension is explained by karma, because
karma has its effects depending on time and space, yet it is not
directly apparent in time and space. Because of karma, an action
done at a very distant point in time and space can have its effects
here and now. Conditionality is therefore not only temporal and
spatial, but also has a karmic dimension.
Let us take two examples to establish more firmly what we
mean by the analytical approach and the relational approach.
Take a chariot, which is a phenomenon, an identifiable entity.
We apply the analytical approach to the chariot by breaking it
down into its component parts: the wheels, axle, body, shaft, and
so forth. Application of the synthetic method looks at the same
chariot in terms of the lumber that goes to it, the action of the
builders who put it together, and so forth. Alternatively, we can
take the classical examples of the flame in an oil lamp, which
exists dependent on the oil and the wick, and the sprout, which
depends on a seed, soil, sunlight, and so forth.
The analytical and the relational methods together yield the
ultimate picture of things as they really are. They yield this ultimate picture through careful investigation. We use the analytical method to break things up into the component parts of an
apparent whole; then we use the relational method to show that
these component parts do not exist independently and separately
but depend on other factors for their existence.
There are many places in the Buddha's teaching where methOds of investigation are used singly and then in combination.
For example, we apply mindfulness first to internal phenomena,
then to external phenomena, and finally both to internal and
external phenomena. By using analysis and relation together, we
overcome many problems. Not only do we overcome the idea of
self, substance, and personality, we also overcome the problems
that result if we believe in the independent existence of separate
factors and ideas like existence and nonexistence, identity and
difference.
The analytical and the synthetic approaches are actually
reflected in the chemistry of the brain. Neurologists have discovered that the brain is divided into two hemispheres, one whose
function is analytical and one whose function is synthetic. If
these two functions are not in harmony, not in balance, personality disturbances result. Someone who is too analytical tends to
overlook the more intuitive, dynamic, fluid aspects of life, while
someone who is too relational tends to lack precision, clarity, and
focus. Thus even in our personal lives we need to combine analytical and relational thinking.
The psychological and neurological dimensions of these two
approaches are also clear in the development of western philosophy and science. Philosophies in which the analytical approach
is predominant have left us with realistic, pluralistic, and atomistic systems like the philosophy of Bertrand Russell. By the same
token, in the latest developments of science, such as quantum
theory, we find a more relational view of reality gaining ground.
When we look at the history of philosophy and science in the
West, we can see that each of these two approaches to investigation has been dominant at one time or another.
Perhaps we are reaching a point where we can combine the
two even in western science and philosophy. Perhaps we can
arrive at a view of reality not too different from the one that the
Abhidharma arrives at through the experience of introspective
meditation — a view of reality that is both analytical (in that it
rejects the idea of a homogeneous whole) and relational (in that it
rejects the idea of independent, separately existing bits and pieces
of reality). We would then have a very fluid and open view of reality in which experience saturated by suffering could be dynamically transformed into experience free from all suffering.

CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT: Analysis of Matter
The Abhidharma is supposed to deal with four ultimate realities — consciousness (chitta), mental states (chetasika), matter
(rupa), and nirvana. Matter shares with consciousness and mental states the character of being a conditioned reality, whereas
nirvana is an unconditioned reality. In considering the three
conditioned realities, we can simultaneously treat the five aggregates of psycho-physical existence.
This harks back to what we said in
about the
Chapter 33
relationship between subject and object, mind and matter. Both
these schemes can be reduced to two elements: the subjective or
mental element, and the objective or material element. On the
one hand we have mind and the mental states — consciousness,
volition, perception, and feeling — and on the other hand we have
the object — form, or matter.
In the context of the Abhidharma, it is important to remember that matter is not something separate from consciousness.
In fact, mind and matter can be simply called the subjective
and objective forms of experience. We will see more precisely
why this is true when we consider the four essentials of matter
(earth, water, fire, and air) as qualities of matter rather than as
the substance of matter. Because Buddhism has a phenomenological approach to existence, matter is only important insofar as
it is an object of experience that affects our psychological being.
Whereas certain other systems assert a radical and absolute dualism, a dichotomy between mind and body, in Buddhism we simply have subjective and objective forms of experience.
In the classification and enumeration of matter in the Abhidharma, matter is divided into twenty-eight elements. The four
primary elements, or four essentials of matter, are simply called
earth, water, fire, and air. However, earth might better be called
'the principle of extension or resistance'; water, 'the principle of
cohesion'; fire, 'the principle of heat'; and air, 'the principle
of motion or oscillation.' These are the four primary building blocks of matter. From them are derived the five physical sense
organs and their objects.
In this context, as well as in the context of the five aggregates, matter refers not only to our bodies but also to the physical
objects of experience that belong to the external world. Beyond
organs and their objects, matter is also present in masculinity and femininity, in the heart, or the principle of vitality, and
in nourishment. There are also six further elements of matter,
which are: the principle of limitation or space, the two principles
of communication (bodily communication and verbal communication), lightness, softness and adaptability. Finally, there are
four elements that are termed 'characteristics': production, duration, destruction, and impermanence.
There are thus twenty-eight components of matter or, to be
more precise, of material experience, in all: the four essentials,
the five sense organs and their corresponding objects, the two
dimensions of sexuality, vitality, nourishment, space, the two
forms of communication, lightness, softness and adaptability
and the four characteristics.
Let us look more closely at the four essentials in terms of
their reality as sensory qualities. It is important to remember
that when we speak of the four primary elements of matter, we
are concerned not with earth, water, fire, and air in themselves
but with the sensory qualities of these elements — the qualities
that we can feel and that give rise to the experience of matter.
Thus we are concerned with sensory qualities like hardness and
softness, which belong to the principle of extension, and warmth
and cold, which belong to the principle of heat. We are not dealing with essences. Rather, we are dealing with qualities that are
experienced.
This means, in turn, that we are dealing with a purely phenomenological treatment of matter, in which sensory qualities
function as the definitive characteristics of matter. It is the sensory qualities that constitute ultimate realities. In other words,
it is neither the table nor my body, but the sensory qualities of
hardness and softness that belong to both the table and my body,
that give rise to the experience of matter. In this context, the
objects of my experience (such as the table and my body) are
conventional realities, whereas the sensory qualities of hardness,
softness, and so forth that give rise to the experience of matter
are ultimate realities.
This is what is called in philosophy a 'modal view,' a view
that concentrates on the qualities of experience rather than on
the essence of experience. To seek the essence of matter is to
enter the world of speculation, to go beyond our empirical experience; to deal with the qualities of matter is to confine ourselves
to phenomena, to experience. It is interesting to note that this
modal view of matter is shared by some modern philosophers,
Bertrand Russell perhaps being the best known among them. It
is this modal view of reality which also informs much contemporary thought about matter. Scientists have come to recognize
matter as a phenomenon, to recognize that it is impossible to
arrive at the essence of matter, and this has been substantiated
by the discovery of the infinite divisibility of the atom.
This modal view of reality has another important implication: Insofar as we take a purely phenomenological and experiential view of reality, of existence, the question of the external
world — in the sense of a reality existing somewhere 'out there,'
beyond the limit of our experience —  does not arise. Insofar as the
external world gives rise to the experience of matter, it is just the
objective or material dimension of our experience, not an independent reality that exists in itself.
On a personal level, we find that our psycho-physical existence is made up of two components: the mental component, or
the mind, and the physical component, or the body. The mind
and the body differ somewhat in their nature — primarily in that
the mind is more pliant and changeable than the body. The
Buddha once said that we might be more justified in regarding the body as the self than the mind, because the body at least
maintains recognizable features for a longer period of time.
We can verify this through our own experience. Our minds
change much more quickly than our bodies. For example, I can
make a mental resolution to refrain from eating starchy foods
and fats, but it will take a considerable amount of time for that
mental change to reflect itself in the shape of my body. The body
is more resistant to change than the mind, and this is in keeping
with the characteristic of earth, as represented in the principle
of resistance. The body is the product of past karma, past consciousness, and is at the same time the basis of present consciousness. This lies at the heart of the uneasiness many intellectuals
have felt about the body. A famous philosopher, Plotinus, once
remarked that he felt like a prisoner in his own body, which he
considered to be like a tomb.
Sometimes we would like to sit longer in meditation were it
not for the physical discomfort we experience as a result of the
body. Sometimes we want to work longer (or to stay awake to
watch a particular television program) but cannot do so because
of the weariness that accompanies the body. There is a tension
between mind and body due to the fact that the body is the
materialized form of past karma, and because of the body's characteristic of resistance, it responds much more slowly to volitional actions than does the mind. Thus the body is, in a sense,
an impediment that hinders mental development.
We see this clearly in the case of liberated beings. In
The Questions of King Milinda, the king asks Nagasena whether
Arhats can experience pain. Nagasena replies that although Arhats
no longer experience mental pain, they can still experience physical pain. Arhats no longer experience mental pain because the
bases for mental pain (aversion, ill-will, and hatred) are no Ionger present, but they can experience physical pain as long as the
basis for physical pain (the body) remains. Until an Arhat enters
final nirvana — 'nirvana without residue,' without the psychophysical personality — the possibility of physical pain remains.
This is why, in the accounts of the Buddha's life and the lives of
his prominent disciples, there are occasions when they experienced physical pain.
The body has a peculiar, intermediate position, in that it is
the product of past consciousness and the basis of present consciousness. This intermediate position is also reflected in the fact
that some bodily functions are conscious and can be controlled
by an act of will, while others are unconscious and proceed automatically. I can decide to eat another plate of food, but it is an
unconscious bodily function that digests or fails to digest the
meal; I cannot will my body to digest it.
Breathing, too, is representative of this intermediate position of the body, because breathing can be either an unconscious function or it can be raised to a volitional and conscious
function for the purpose of concentrating and calming the body
and mind. In coping with our existence as a composite of mind
and body, we need to remember that the mind represents the
dynamic, fluid, and volitional principle, while the body represents the principle of resistance. Because of this, it is not possible for the body to change as quickly as the mind in the process
of development and liberation.

**Slide Title:** Cracking Consciousness: The Abhidharma's Deep Dive

---

### **Why Consciousness Matters**

- **Suffering Starts Here:** Only conscious beings experience suffering—it's a mind game.
- **Ignorance Splits Us:** Believing in a permanent self divides consciousness into "me" vs. "other," leading to craving and suffering.

### **Experience Over Essence**

- **Phenomenological Approach:** Buddhism focuses on how we experience things, not on their inherent essence.
- **Mind and Matter as Experiences:** They're forms of experience, not ultimate facts.

### **Classifying Consciousness**

**A. **By Object** (What Consciousness Focuses On)**

1. **Sense-Sphere Consciousness (Kamavachara):**
   - Directed toward the world of sense desire.
   - Objects are material and limited—like scrolling through Reddit.

2. **Form-Sphere Consciousness (Rupavachara):**
   - Directed toward the sphere of form.
   - Objects are immaterial but still limited—imagine visualizing concepts.

3. **Formless-Sphere Consciousness (Arupavachara):**
   - Directed toward the formless sphere.
   - Objects are immaterial and unlimited—thinking about infinity or space.

4. **Supramundane Consciousness (Lokuttara):**
   - Directed toward Nirvana.
   - Associated with transcendental states—the ultimate enlightenment quest.

**B. **By Nature** (How Consciousness Operates)**

1. **Wholesome (Kusala):**
   - Karmically active; leads to positive outcomes.
   - Linked with generosity, kindness, and wisdom.

2. **Unwholesome (Akusala):**
   - Karmically active; leads to negative outcomes.
   - Associated with greed, hate, and delusion—like feeding internet trolls.

3. **Resultant (Vipaka):**
   - Karmically passive; the result of past actions.
   - Can't produce further karma—like reaping what you've sown.

4. **Functional (Kiriya):**
   - Neither produces nor results from karma.
   - Actions are immediate and functional—like an enlightened being's spontaneous compassion.

### **Feelings, Knowledge, and Volition**

- **Feelings:**
  - **Agreeable, Disagreeable, Indifferent:** Can be physical or mental—like upvotes (agreeable) or downvotes (disagreeable).
  - **Context Matters:** Physical discomfort vs. emotional pain.

- **Knowledge:**
  - **With Correct Understanding:** Seeing things as they are—clear perception.
  - **Without Understanding:** Lacking insight—like misunderstanding sarcasm online.
  - **With Wrong Views:** Holding misconceptions—spreading fake news unintentionally.

- **Volition:**
  - **Automatic Consciousness:** Arises without deliberate intent—habitual scrolling.
  - **Volitional Consciousness:** Involves intentional actions—choosing to engage in meaningful discussions.

### **Metaphors & Similes**

- **Tax Collection Analogy (Dhammasangani Commentary):**
  - **Story:** A king taxes people based on their roles (farmers, merchants), not their individual identities.
  - **Lesson:** Consciousness factors are classified by their function, not by a fixed essence—like wearing different hats in various subreddits.

### **Multivalent Terms**

- **Context is Key:**
  - **"Suffering" and "Happiness":** Mean different things in different contexts.
  - **Stay Flexible:** Avoid rigid definitions—interpret terms based on the situation, like understanding memes in different communities.

### **Why This Matters**

- **Understanding Consciousness:**
  - Helps us see how our mind constructs reality—awareness is the first step to change.
- **Transforming Suffering:**
  - By recognizing how consciousness works, we can reduce suffering—like debugging your mental software.
- **Practical Application:**
  - Use this knowledge to cultivate wholesome states and diminish unwholesome ones—curate your mental feed for well-being.

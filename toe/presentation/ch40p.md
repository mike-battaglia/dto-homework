     - Awareness of pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral sensations as they arise.

  3. **Mindfulness of Consciousness (Cittānupassanā):**
     - Observing the transient nature of mental states.

  4. **Mindfulness of Mental Phenomena (Dhammānupassanā):**
     - Contemplation of the impermanence of thoughts and mental constructs.

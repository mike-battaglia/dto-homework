**Slide Title:** The Web of Existence: Understanding Conditionality in the Abhidharma

### **Why Conditionality Matters**

- **Balancing Analysis and Connection:**
  - **Avoid Fragmentation:** Overanalyzing reality can lead to seeing life as disconnected pieces—like browsing random subreddits without seeing the bigger picture.
  - **Embrace the Relational Approach:** Understanding how everything is connected helps us avoid extremes and find the Middle Way.

- **The Middle Way:**
  - **Avoiding Extremes:**
    - **Eternalism:** Believing in a permanent self—like thinking your Reddit username is your true identity.
    - **Nihilism:** Denying any continuity or responsibility—like deleting your account and thinking your actions leave no trace.

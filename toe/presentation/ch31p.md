**Slide Title:** Navigating the Mind: Philosophy and Psychology in the Abhidharma

---

### **Buddhism Beyond Labels**

- **Not Just a Religion:** Buddhism doesn't always fit the traditional "religion" mold—no central god or mandatory rituals.
- **Philosophy & Psychology Mashup:** Think of it as a blend of deep philosophical inquiry and practical psychology—like an ancient self-help subreddit.

### **Phenomenology & Self-Therapy**

- **Phenomenology:** Focuses on experiencing reality directly—seeing things as they are, not as we wish them to be.
- **Psychotherapy:** Offers tools to heal the mind—addressing suffering and promoting well-being. It's like doing a mental health AMA with the Buddha.

### **The Buddha's Skillful Teaching**

- **Adaptable Answers:** The Buddha knew one size doesn't fit all—he tailored his teachings like crafting the perfect Reddit response.
- **Four Types of Questions:**
  1. **Straightforward Answers:** Clear "Yes" or "No"—no ambiguity.
  2. **Detailed Explanations:** Requires some unpacking—like explaining a complex meme.
  3. **Counter-Questions:** Answering with a question to clarify—think Socratic method.
  4. **Silence:** Sometimes the best response to a flame war is no response.

### **The Fourteen Unanswerable Questions**

- **Examples:** Is the universe eternal? Does the self exist after death?
- **Buddha's Silence:** Engaging in these is like debating flat earth theories—it distracts from practical wisdom.

### **Avoiding Extremes with the Middle Way**

- **No Absolutes:** Steer clear of black-and-white thinking—it's not just existence *or* non-existence.
- **Dependent Origination:** Everything is interconnected—like the web of Reddit threads leading you down various rabbit holes.

### **Mind Over Matter**

- **Mind is the Forerunner:** "All that we are is the result of what we have thought." (Dhammapada)
- **Shape Your Reality:** A pure mind leads to happiness; an impure mind leads to suffering—curate your mental feed wisely.

### **Metaphors & Similes**

- **Water-Snake Simile:**
  - **Story:** Grabbing a snake improperly leads to a bite.
  - **Lesson:** Handle teachings carefully—misinterpretation can cause harm, just like misreading sarcasm online.

- **Knife Analogy:**
  - **Story:** A knife isn't inherently good or bad; it's all about how you use it.
  - **Lesson:** Phenomena are neutral—your approach determines the outcome.

### **The Vacchagotta Encounter**

- **The Self Inquiry:**
  - **Vacchagotta:** "Does the self exist?"
  - **Buddha:** Chooses silence.
- **Why the Silent Treatment?** Any answer reinforces wrong views—sometimes not feeding the trolls is the best policy.

### **Buddhism's Unique Path**

- **No Permanent Self:** Unlike many philosophies, Buddhism denies an eternal self—everything is in flux.
- **Aim for Liberation:** Offers a practical path to freedom from suffering—not just intellectual debates.

### **Why This Matters**

- **Practical Application:** Buddhism isn't about armchair philosophy—it's about actionable steps to improve your life.
- **Relatable Wisdom:** Just as you'd filter out negativity on Reddit, Buddhism teaches how to cultivate a healthy mind.

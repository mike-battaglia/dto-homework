### Slide Layout and Content

**Title:** Transitioning from Mundane to Supramundane Consciousness

**Main Points:**

1. **Mundane Consciousness:**
   - Governed by Karma
   - Engages with Conditioned Phenomena

2. **Supramundane Consciousness:**
   - Oriented Toward Liberation
   - Dominated by Wisdom
   - Aimed at the Unconditioned

3. **Stages of Enlightenment:**
   - Stream-Enterer (Overcomes Three Fetters)
   - Once-Returner (Weakens Two Fetters)
   - Non-Returner (Eliminates Sensual Desire and Ill-Will)
   - Arhat (Overcomes Final Five Fetters)

**Artistic Visual Element:**

- **Conceptual Mandala:**
  - **Design:** A central lotus flower symbolizing the ultimate goal of enlightenment, surrounded by concentric rings representing the stages of consciousness. Each ring is divided into quadrants, each with symbols representing the stages of enlightenment (e.g., a key for Stream-Enterer, a feather for Once-Returner, a flame for Non-Returner, and a shining star for Arhat). The outermost circle shows the transition from mundane to supramundane consciousness with arrows pointing inward, indicating progression.
  - **Color Scheme:** Use calming blues and purples for the mundane spheres, transitioning to warm golds and whites as it progresses to the center, symbolizing enlightenment and Nirvana.

**Presenter's Script:**

"Now, let's delve into the intriguing journey from mundane to supramundane consciousness—a transition that is both profound and transformative. Here, we see how mundane consciousness, much like an algorithm, is shaped by past karma and the conditions of existence. It engages with the transient nature of our experiences, often leaving us in a state of flux.

In contrast, supramundane consciousness is a beacon guiding us toward liberation. It's characterized by wisdom, steering us away from habitual impulses and directing us toward the 'unborn, uncreated'—the very essence of Nirvana.

This journey is marked by the stages of enlightenment: the Stream-Enterer, who overcomes the first three fetters; the Once-Returner, who weakens the hold of sensual desire and ill-will; the Non-Returner, who completely sheds these desires; and finally, the Arhat, who transcends the final five fetters to attain complete liberation.

Our visual mandala here illustrates this journey beautifully. Notice how the outer rings, representing mundane consciousness, gradually transition into the warm, radiant center of supramundane consciousness. Each quadrant symbolizes a stage of enlightenment, guiding us inward toward the ultimate goal.

Understanding and cultivating supramundane consciousness is not just a philosophical endeavor—it's a practical path to transforming our existence, offering immediate spiritual benefits and leading us to the cessation of suffering. This is the essence of what it means to move from the distractions and attachments of the mundane world to the freedom of the unconditioned."

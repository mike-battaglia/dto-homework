**Title:** Navigating the Mind: Philosophy and Psychology in the Abhidharma

**Main Visual Element:**
Create an image of a serene, contemplative Buddha sitting under a Bodhi tree, surrounded by an ethereal light that symbolizes enlightenment. The tree's branches extend outward, morphing into abstract representations of the mind—thoughts, emotions, and philosophical concepts, depicted as flowing streams of light and color. The background should include subtle elements of ancient scrolls and symbols of psychology (such as a brain or neural pathways), blending seamlessly with the natural setting to emphasize the integration of philosophy and psychology.

### **Chapter 33: Analysis of Consciousness**

---

#### **Key Concepts**

- **Consciousness and Suffering**
  - Suffering arises in consciousness due to **ignorance (avidya)**.
  - Ignorance divides consciousness into **subject (self)** and **object (other-than-self)**.

- **Abhidharma's Analysis of Consciousness**
  - Begins by classifying consciousness to address the root of suffering.

- **Classification Systems**
  1. **Objective Classification** *(Objects of Consciousness)*
     - **Sense-sphere (kamavachara)**: Directed toward sense desires.
     - **Form-sphere (rupavachara)**: Oriented toward the sphere of form.
     - **Formless-sphere (arupavachara)**: Focused on the formless sphere.
     - **Supramundane (lokuttara)**: Directed toward nirvana; consciousness of the enlightened.

  2. **Subjective Classification** *(Nature of Consciousness)*
     - **Wholesome (kusala)**: Leads toward liberation; conditioned by non-greed, non-ill-will, non-delusion.
     - **Unwholesome (akusala)**: Perpetuates suffering; rooted in greed, ill-will, delusion.
     - **Resultant (vipaka)**: The ripened results of actions; not karmically active.
     - **Functional (kiriya)**: Actions without karmic potential; includes deeds of enlightened beings.

- **Further Classifications**
  - **Feeling**: Agreeable, disagreeable, indifferent.
  - **Knowledge**: Presence or absence of correct understanding.
  - **Volition**: Automatic vs. intentional actions.

- **Understanding Terms in Context**
  - Terms are **multivalent**; meanings shift with context and function.
  - **Metaphors**:
    - **Ignorance** as the **root** of a tree; **greed, ill-will, delusion** as its **branches**.
    - **Consciousness factors** classified like taxpayers by function, not identity.

### **Presenter's Script**

"Welcome back, everyone.

Let's dive into **Chapter 33: Analysis of Consciousness**.

This chapter reminds us of the central role consciousness plays in our experience of suffering. As we know, suffering arises within consciousness, and in Buddhist philosophy, it's driven by **ignorance**, or **avidya**. This fundamental not knowing divides our consciousness into a **subject**—the self—and an **object**—everything we perceive as other-than-self.

This division is the root of our suffering. It creates tension, craving, and aversion because we cling to things that support our notion of self and push away those that don't. So, to address suffering, the **Abhidharma** begins by analyzing consciousness itself.

It introduces two primary ways to classify consciousness.

First is the **Objective Classification**, which focuses on where consciousness is directed:

1. **Sense-sphere consciousness (kamavachara)**: This is oriented toward our sensory world—the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches we experience daily.
   
2. **Form-sphere consciousness (rupavachara)**: This takes us deeper, into meditative states associated with form but beyond ordinary sensory experiences.
   
3. **Formless-sphere consciousness (arupavachara)**: Here, consciousness moves into even more refined meditative states where the concept of form dissolves.
   
4. **Supramundane consciousness (lokuttara)**: This is the consciousness directed toward **nirvana**, associated with enlightened beings—the stream-winner, once-returner, non-returner, and the liberated one.

Second is the **Subjective Classification**, which looks at the nature of consciousness:

- **Wholesome (kusala)** consciousness leads us toward liberation. It's conditioned by **non-greed, non-ill-will, and non-delusion**.
  
- **Unwholesome (akusala)** consciousness keeps us stuck in the cycle of suffering. It's rooted in **greed, ill-will, and delusion**—the branches growing from the root of ignorance.
  
- **Resultant (vipaka)** consciousness refers to the outcomes of our actions. It's not karmically active because it's the fruit, not the seed.
  
- **Functional (kiriya)** consciousness includes actions without karmic potential, like those of enlightened beings whose deeds don't create new karma.

Consciousness is further classified by:

- **Feeling**: Whether our experiences are agreeable, disagreeable, or indifferent.

- **Knowledge**: Whether correct understanding is present or absent.

- **Volition**: Whether actions are automatic or intentional.

An essential point the chapter makes is about understanding terms in context. In the **Abhidharma**, words are **multivalent**, meaning their definitions shift based on how they're used. For example, **'dukkha'** can refer to physical suffering in one context and encompass both physical and mental suffering in another.

To drive this home, the chapter uses a couple of metaphors:

- Think of **ignorance** as the **root of a tree**. From this root grow the branches of **greed, ill-will, and delusion**, which in turn bear the fruits of suffering.

- Another metaphor compares consciousness factors to taxpayers classified by their roles, not their identities. Just as a king collects taxes based on people's functions—like being a property owner or a merchant—so are consciousness factors categorized by their functions rather than any inherent essence.

To help visualize this, imagine the **artistic depiction** described on the slide: *An intricate painting of a tree with deep roots symbolizing ignorance, its branches spreading into greed, ill-will, and delusion. This image illustrates how suffering grows from the mistaken notion of a separate self.*

By understanding that terms and factors in Buddhism are fluid and must be interpreted within their context, we embrace the **phenomenological** approach of Buddhist philosophy. We focus on experiences as they arise, without imposing rigid definitions that can limit our understanding.

In essence, this chapter emphasizes that to alleviate suffering, we need to analyze consciousness thoroughly. By recognizing how ignorance conditions our experience and leads to the division between self and other, we can begin to dissolve the roots of suffering and move toward liberation.

Thank you for your attention. Let's open the floor for any questions or reflections you might have on this intricate exploration of consciousness."

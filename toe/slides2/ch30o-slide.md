**Presenter's Script**:

*"Hey everyone! Let's dive into the intriguing world of the **Abhidharma**, which translates to 'Higher Dharma' or 'Special Teaching'. So, what's the big deal about it? Well, the Abhidharma delves into the ultimate reality of things, going beyond the surface to explore the true nature of existence.*

*Throughout Buddhist history, the Abhidharma has been held in high regard across various traditions like Theravada and Tibetan Buddhism. Great scholars, including **Kumarajiva**, emphasized its importance. But why? Because it's essential for cultivating **wisdom**, or **prajña**, which is crucial for achieving **freedom** from suffering.*

*Now, the term 'Abhidharma' can mean different things. Generally, it refers to meditation or discussion about the Dharma. In a more technical sense, it's about defining, analyzing, classifying, and arranging **dharmas**, which are the fundamental phenomena of our experience.*

*One fascinating aspect is the two standpoints the Buddha used in his teachings: the **conventional (vohāra)** and the **ultimate (paramattha)**. The conventional standpoint is all about our everyday language—using terms like 'I', 'you', and referring to tangible beings and objects. The ultimate standpoint, however, gets into the deep stuff, highlighting concepts like **impermanence (anicca)**, **non-self (anattā)**, and **insubstantiality (suññatā)**.*

*The Abhidharma primarily operates from this ultimate standpoint, helping us see beyond illusions. Interestingly, you can find Abhidharmic teachings even in the Sutra Pitaka, like in the **Sangīti Sutta**, **Dasuttara Sutta**, and **Anupada Sutta**, where the Buddha's top disciple, **Sāriputta**, shares profound insights.*

*So, why did the Buddha teach using both standpoints? It showcases his incredible skill as a teacher. By adapting his approach, he could reach people wherever they were on their spiritual journey. While he used the conventional standpoint to communicate effectively with everyone, he introduced the ultimate standpoint to guide us toward deeper understanding.*

*To bring this to life, imagine the Buddha during the week called the **'House of Gems'**—a period after his enlightenment where he meditated intensely on the Abhidharma. He even traveled to the **Trayatrimsha Heaven** to teach these profound truths to the gods and his mother. This highlights just how essential the Abhidharma is within Buddhist practice.*

*So, the Abhidharma isn't just ancient philosophy—it's a practical guide that helps us apply the wisdom of impermanence, non-self, and insubstantiality to our daily lives. It's about transforming our understanding to achieve true freedom."*

Imagine a serene illustration of a **lotus flower** floating on calm waters. The lotus has two layers of petals:

- The **outer petals** represent the **Conventional standpoint (Vohara)**, open and accessible, symbolizing everyday teachings.
- The **inner petals** unveil the **Ultimate standpoint (Paramattha)**, deeper and closer to the heart of the flower, symbolizing profound wisdom.
  
At the center is a subtle glow, representing the **Abhidharma** as the essence that bridges the outer and inner layers, guiding practitioners from conventional understanding to ultimate insight.

**Presenter's Script:**

"Hello everyone,

Today, we're diving into the fascinating world of the **Abhidharma**, which is essentially the philosophical and psychological backbone of Buddhism. The term itself means 'higher Dharma' or 'special Dharma', pointing to its role in deepening our understanding beyond the basic teachings.

So, why is the Abhidharma so significant? Throughout Buddhist history, it's been held in high esteem across various traditions—be it Theravada, Mahayana, or Tibetan Buddhism. It's considered essential for attaining wisdom, which in turn is crucial for achieving liberation or freedom. No matter how much we meditate or how virtuous our lives are, without this wisdom, true freedom remains elusive.

Our objectives today are threefold:

1. To outline the principal methods and characteristics of the Abhidharma.
2. To see how it relates to the teachings of the Buddha.
3. And importantly, to understand how we, as lay practitioners, can apply its philosophy in our daily lives.

Speaking of origins, the Abhidharma is traditionally attributed directly to the **Buddha** himself. It's said that upon his enlightenment, he penetrated its essence. He later taught it to the gods and to his foremost disciple, **Sariputta**, renowned for his wisdom.

Now, a key concept in the Abhidharma is understanding **dharmas**—the fundamental phenomena or factors of our experience. The Abhidharma focuses on five aspects concerning dharmas: defining them, understanding their relationships, analyzing, classifying, and arranging them.

An interesting point is the Buddha's use of two standpoints in his teachings: the **Conventional standpoint (Vohara)** and the **Ultimate standpoint (Paramattha)**. On one hand, he spoke in everyday terms—we hear stories where he says things like 'I will go to such and such place.' This makes the teachings accessible. On the other hand, he taught that there is no 'I' or 'self', emphasizing impermanence and insubstantiality—the ultimate truths.

Why did he do this? It's all about **skillful means**, or 'upaya'. The Buddha tailored his teachings to suit the audience's capacity to understand. If he spoke only in ultimate terms, it might have been too abstract for many. By balancing both, he guided people gradually from conventional understanding to deeper insight.

To visualize this, think of a **lotus flower**—which I've included in the slide. The outer petals represent the conventional teachings, open and inviting. As you move inward, the petals symbolize the ultimate teachings, leading us deeper into understanding. At the heart of the lotus is the glow of the Abhidharma, bridging the two and illuminating our path to wisdom.

In the coming sessions, we'll explore how this profound teaching not only ties back to the Buddha's original discourses but also how it applies to us today, helping us navigate our experiences with greater clarity.

Thank you."

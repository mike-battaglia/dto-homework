**Overview of Chapter Thirty-Five: Supramundane Consciousness**

Chapter Thirty-Five concludes the analysis of consciousness as presented in the first book of the Abhidharma Pitaka, the **Dhammasangani (Classification of Factors)**. This chapter focuses on the fourth objective classification of consciousness: **supramundane consciousness (lokuttara citta)**. It distinguishes supramundane consciousness from mundane consciousness—comprising the sense-sphere, form-sphere, and formless-sphere consciousness—by exploring their characteristics and significance on the path to enlightenment.

**Key Distinctions Between Supramundane and Mundane Consciousness:**

1. **Determination and Direction:**
   - **Mundane Consciousness:** Determined by karma and conditions; undirected and subject to forces beyond one's control.
   - **Supramundane Consciousness:** Determining and directed toward the goal of liberation; predominated by wisdom rather than karma.

2. **Object of Consciousness:**
   - **Mundane Consciousness:** Engages with conditioned phenomena.
   - **Supramundane Consciousness:** Oriented toward the unconditioned, namely **nirvana**, which the Buddha described as an unborn and uncreated state necessary for liberation from suffering.

**Classification of Supramundane Consciousness:**

- **Eight Types:** Divided into four active (path) and four passive (fruit) consciousnesses, corresponding to the four stages of enlightenment:
  1. **Stream-Winner (Sotāpanna)**
  2. **Once-Returner (Sakadāgāmī)**
  3. **Non-Returner (Anāgāmī)**
  4. **Arhat**

- **Immediate Resultant Consciousness:** Unlike mundane consciousness, where results may manifest in future lives, the resultant (fruit) consciousness in the supramundane arises immediately after the active (path) consciousness.

- **Expansion to Forty Types:** Each of the eight types combines with the five form-sphere absorptions (jhānas), resulting in 40 distinct supramundane consciousness states (20 active and 20 resultant).

**The Four Stages of Enlightenment and the Ten Fetters:**

1. **Stream-Winner (Sotāpanna):** Overcomes the first three fetters:
   - **Belief in a Permanent Self (Sakkāya-diṭṭhi):** Misidentification of the five aggregates as a self.
   - **Doubt (Vicikicchā):** Skepticism about the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, and the principles of the path.
   - **Attachment to Rites and Rituals (Sīlabbata-parāmāsa):** Belief that mere adherence to rituals leads to liberation.

   *Outcome:* Guaranteed liberation within seven lifetimes, no rebirth in lower realms, and unwavering faith in the Triple Gem.

2. **Once-Returner (Sakadāgāmī):** Weakens the next two fetters:
   - **Sensual Desire (Kāma-rāga)**
   - **Ill-Will (Vyāpāda)**

3. **Non-Returner (Anāgāmī):** Completely eradicates sensual desire and ill-will.

4. **Arhat:** Eliminates the final five fetters:
   - **Attachment to the Form Sphere (Rūpa-rāga)**
   - **Attachment to the Formless Sphere (Arūpa-rāga)**
   - **Conceit (Māna)**
   - **Restlessness (Uddhacca)**
   - **Ignorance (Avijjā)**

**Developing Insight (Paññā) Through Analysis and Synthesis:**

- **Analytical Method:** Dissects mind and matter to reveal their impermanent and insubstantial nature.
- **Synthetic (Relational) Method:** Examines the causes and conditions—ignorance, craving, clinging, karma, and nourishment—that sustain personal existence.

**Realization of the Three Universal Characteristics:**

1. **Impermanence (Anicca)**
2. **Suffering (Dukkha)**
3. **Not-Self (Anattā)**

Understanding these leads to renunciation and directs consciousness toward nirvana.

**Progressing Toward Liberation:**

- **Three Doors of Liberation:**
  - **Door of Signlessness (Animitta):** Through contemplating impermanence.
  - **Door of Wishlessness (Appaṇihita):** Through contemplating suffering.
  - **Door of Emptiness (Suññatā):** Through contemplating not-self.

- **Analogies for Insight:**
  - **Flash of Lightning:** The initial glimpse of nirvana that illuminates the path.
  - **Learning to Bicycle:** Gradual skill acquisition reflecting the deepening of insight.

**Reaffirming the Value of Arhatship:**

The chapter concludes by addressing misconceptions about Arhatship being selfish or passive. It emphasizes that Arhats like **Sāriputta** and **Moggallāna** were active in teaching and benefiting others. The Buddha encouraged his Arhat disciples to aid in the liberation of all beings, highlighting that Arhatship is a state of compassion and altruism.

**Metaphors, Similes, and Sutras Referenced**

- **Metaphors and Similes:**
  - **Banana Tree Analogy:** The three mundane spheres are likened to a banana tree, which is without essence, illustrating the insubstantiality of conditioned existence.
  - **Flash of Lightning:** Represents the first fleeting vision of nirvana, providing clarity and direction amid the darkness of ignorance.
  - **Learning to Bicycle:** Symbolizes the gradual and confident progression toward enlightenment after initial success.
  
- **Three Doors of Liberation:**
  - **Door of Signlessness (Animitta):** Achieved by contemplating impermanence.
  - **Door of Wishlessness (Appaṇihita):** Achieved by contemplating suffering.
  - **Door of Emptiness (Suññatā):** Achieved by contemplating not-self.

- **Sutras and Texts Referenced:**
  - **Biographical Account of Khema (Referenced from Chapter 22):** An example of a disciple who attained liberation through the contemplation of impermanence.
  - **Dhammasangani (Classification of Factors):** The first book of the Abhidharma Pitaka, concluding with this chapter's exploration of consciousness.

By integrating the analytical and synthetic methods to understand the impermanent, unsatisfactory, and selfless nature of phenomena, practitioners can transform mundane consciousness into supramundane consciousness oriented toward nirvana. This chapter emphasizes that the path to Arhatship is both a personal liberation and a foundation for compassionate action in the world.

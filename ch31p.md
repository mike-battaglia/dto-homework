</ul>
<h3 id="phenomenology--self-therapy"><strong>Phenomenology &amp; Self-Therapy</strong></h3>

<li><strong>Phenomenology:</strong> Focuses on experiencing reality directly—seeing things as they are, not as we wish them to be.</li>

<li><strong>Dependent Origination:</strong> Everything is interconnected—like the web of Reddit threads leading you down various rabbit holes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mind-over-matter"><strong>Mind Over Matter</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mind is the Forerunner:</strong> “All that we are is the result of what we have thought.” (Dhammapada)</li>

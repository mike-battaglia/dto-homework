**Overview of Chapter Thirty-Six: Analysis of Mental States**

Chapter Thirty-Six delves into the Abhidharma's detailed examination of mental states (*cetasikas*) and their intrinsic relationship with consciousness (*citta*). The chapter emphasizes that mental states are factors associated with consciousness; they arise and perish alongside consciousness and share the same object and bases. Understanding this relationship is crucial for comprehending how our conscious experiences are constructed and how we can transform them.

**Key Themes and Concepts:**

1. **Relationship Between Consciousness and Mental States:**
   - **Analogy of Framework and Building Materials:** The relationship is likened to a skeleton and the flesh that covers it or the framework of a building and the materials that fill it. Here, consciousness is the skeleton or framework, and mental states are the flesh or materials that build up the body of conscious experience.
   - This analogy highlights that while consciousness provides the structure, it is the mental states that fill in and give character to our experiences.

2. **Categories of Mental States:**
   - **Three General Categories:**
     1. **Wholesome Mental States:** Lead to desirable outcomes and support liberation.
     2. **Unwholesome Mental States:** Lead to undesirable outcomes and perpetuate suffering.
     3. **Unspecified Mental States:** Neither inherently wholesome nor unwholesome but take on the nature of the mental states they accompany.

3. **Unspecified Mental States:**
   - **Role in Conscious Experience:** They act as the cement in building experience, essential for holding together other mental factors.
   - **Two Groups:**
     - **Universal (Primary) Mental States:** Present in all types of consciousness without exception. These include:
       1. **Contact:** The conjunction of consciousness with an object.
       2. **Feeling:** The emotional tone—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
       3. **Perception:** Recognition of the sensory domain of the experience.
       4. **Volition:** The instinctive mental response, not to be confused with free will.
       5. **One-Pointedness:** The focus on a particular object, isolating it from the stream of consciousness.
       6. **Attention:** Directing awareness toward a specific object.
       7. **Vitality:** The life force that binds together the other mental states.
     - **Particular (Secondary) Mental States:** Occur only in certain types of consciousness. These include:
       1. **Initial Application:** The mind's initial engagement with an object.
       2. **Sustained Application:** The continued focus on that object.
       3. **Decision (Adhimokkha):** Liberation from doubt; a decisive mental state.
       4. **Envy:** A mental factor that can arise under certain conditions.
       5. **Interest (Pīti):** Enthusiasm or joyful interest.
       6. **Desire (Chanda):** Can be wholesome or unwholesome depending on its object and associated states.

4. **Unwholesome Mental States:**
   - **Fourteen Unwholesome Mental States:** Associated with the twelve unwholesome types of consciousness, grouped based on the three unwholesome roots—delusion, greed, and ill-will—and two additional factors, sloth and torpor, and doubt.
   - **Groups of Unwholesome Mental States:**
     1. **Delusion-Dominated Group:** Includes delusion, shamelessness, fearlessness of wrongdoing, and restlessness.
     2. **Greed-Dominated Group:** Includes greed, wrong views, and conceit.
     3. **Ill-Will Group:** Includes ill-will, envy, avarice, and worry.
     4. **Sloth and Torpor:** Hindrances to mental clarity and volition.
     5. **Doubt:** Inhibits decision and clear understanding.

5. **Wholesome Mental States:**
   - **Nineteen Universal Wholesome Mental States:** Present in all wholesome consciousness types and include factors conducive to enlightenment (*bodhipakkhiya dhamma*) such as faith, mindfulness, shame, dread of wrongdoing, non-greed, non-hatred, balance of mind, tranquility, and others.
   - **Additional Wholesome Mental States:** Six factors that may accompany the wholesome mental states:
     1. **Three Abstinences:** Right speech, right action, and right livelihood.
     2. **Two Immeasurables (Brahmaviharas):** Compassion and appreciative joy.
     3. **Wisdom (Paññā):** Can be mundane or supramundane based on its object.

6. **Interaction Between Mental States and Consciousness:**
   - The types of consciousness are determined by the presence of specific mental states, which influence their karmic value, emotional tone, intellectual association, and volitional aspect.
   - **Fourfold Subjective Classification:**
     - **Karmic Value:** Wholesome, unwholesome, or neutral.
     - **Emotional Value:** Pleasant, unpleasant, or indifferent feelings.
     - **Intellectual Value:** Associated with knowledge, disassociated from knowledge, or associated with wrong beliefs.
     - **Volitional Value:** Prompted (non-spontaneous) or unprompted (spontaneous).

7. **Counteracting Unwholesome Mental States:**
   - **Chemical Analogy:** Just as acids and bases neutralize each other in chemistry, wholesome mental states counteract unwholesome ones.
   - **Examples:**
     - **Faith** counters **doubt** and **delusion**.
     - **Tranquility** counters **restlessness** and **worry**.
     - **Lightness** and **elasticity of mind** counter **sloth and torpor**.
     - **Decision** eliminates **doubt**.
   - Understanding these relationships allows practitioners to cultivate wholesome mental states and reduce unwholesome ones, thereby transforming their conscious experience.

**Metaphors and Similes Referenced:**

- **Framework and Building Materials/Skeleton and Flesh:** Illustrates how consciousness provides the structure while mental states fill in the substance of our experiences.
- **Cement in Building Experience:** Unspecified mental states are likened to cement, essential for holding the building blocks of experience together.
- **Chemical Properties Analogy:** The interaction of mental states is compared to chemical reactions, where certain elements neutralize or counteract others.

**Conclusion:**

By thoroughly analyzing mental states and their interplay with consciousness, Chapter Thirty-Six underscores the importance of mindfulness and intentional cultivation of wholesome mental states. Recognizing how mental states influence the nature of our consciousness empowers practitioners to transform their experiences, reduce suffering, and progress on the path toward liberation.

**Overview of Chapter Thirty-Three: Analysis of Consciousness**

Chapter Thirty-Three focuses on the analysis of consciousness within the Abhidharma philosophy, emphasizing its importance in understanding and overcoming suffering. The chapter serves as the first of three dedicated to this subject, exploring various systems for classifying consciousness, with a particular focus on sense-sphere consciousness.

**Key Themes and Concepts:**

1. **Consciousness as the Starting Point:**
   - **Suffering and Consciousness:** The chapter begins by explaining that suffering is fundamentally a problem of consciousness. Only beings with consciousness can experience suffering.
   - **Ignorance and Division:** Ignorance (avidya), defined as the belief in a permanent, independent self, leads to the division of consciousness into subject (self) and object (other-than-self). This division gives rise to craving, aversion, and ultimately, suffering.

2. **Phenomenological Approach:**
   - **Experience Over Essence:** Buddhism treats mind and matter as forms of experience rather than ultimate metaphysical facts. This phenomenological stance means that the analysis is concerned with how phenomena are experienced, not with their inherent essence.

3. **Systems for Classifying Consciousness:**

   **A. Objective Classification (Based on the Object of Consciousness):**
   - **Four Classes of Consciousness:**
     1. **Sense-Sphere Consciousness (Kamavachara):** Directed toward the world of sense desire; objects are material and limited.
     2. **Form-Sphere Consciousness (Rupavachara):** Directed toward the sphere of form; objects are immaterial but still limited.
     3. **Formless-Sphere Consciousness (Arupavachara):** Directed toward the formless sphere; objects are immaterial and unlimited.
     4. **Supramundane Consciousness (Lokuttara):** Directed toward Nirvana; associated with the transcendental and the consciousness of the four types of noble ones (stream-winner, once-returner, non-returner, and liberated one).
   - **Progressive Unification:** There is a progression from material and limited objects to immaterial and unlimited objects, reflecting a deepening focus in meditation and understanding.

   **B. Subjective Classification (Based on the Nature of Consciousness):**
   - **Four Classes of Consciousness:**
     1. **Wholesome Consciousness (Kusala):** Karmically active; leads to desirable results; associated with non-greed, non-ill-will, and non-delusion.
     2. **Unwholesome Consciousness (Akusala):** Karmically active; leads to undesirable results; associated with greed, ill-will, and delusion.
     3. **Resultant Consciousness (Vipaka):** Karmically passive; the result of past wholesome or unwholesome actions; cannot produce further karmic results.
     4. **Ineffective or Functional Consciousness (Kiriya):** Neither produces karmic results nor is a result of karma; actions are functional and immediate, such as those performed by enlightened beings.
   - **Therapeutic Concern:** The emphasis on wholesome and unwholesome consciousness highlights the therapeutic aim of Buddhismâ€”to alleviate suffering by transforming consciousness.

   **C. Classification Based on Feeling, Knowledge, and Volition:**
   - **Feeling:**
     - **Emotional Qualities:** Consciousness is associated with agreeable, disagreeable, or indifferent feelings.
     - **Expanded Categories:** These can be further divided into physically and mentally agreeable or disagreeable feelings.
   - **Knowledge:**
     - **Presence of Correct Knowledge:** Consciousness accompanied by understanding the true nature of the object.
     - **Absence of Correct Knowledge:** Consciousness without such understanding.
     - **Presence of Erroneous Knowledge:** Consciousness accompanied by wrong views.
   - **Volition:**
     - **Automatic Consciousness:** Arises without deliberate intent.
     - **Volitional Consciousness:** Involves intentional mental actions.

4. **Sense-Sphere Consciousness (Kamavachara):**
   - **Fifty-Four Types of Consciousness:** Divided into three groups:
     1. **Twelve Unwholesome Consciousnesses:** Karmically active; conditioned by greed, ill-will, or delusion.
     2. **Eighteen Resultant Consciousnesses:** Karmically passive; results of past actions; includes experiences through the six senses.
     3. **Twenty-Four Wholesome Consciousnesses:** Karmically active; conditioned by non-greed, non-ill-will, and non-delusion.

5. **Multivalent Nature of Terms and Factors:**
   - **Functional Classification:** Factors of consciousness are classified based on their function rather than their inherent essence.
   - **Contextual Understanding:** Terms like "suffering" (dukkha) and "happiness" (sukha) can have different meanings depending on the context. For example, "suffering" may refer to physical discomfort in one context and encompass both physical and mental suffering in another.
   - **Avoiding Rigid Definitions:** Understanding terms in their specific context prevents misinterpretation and aligns with the phenomenological approach of Buddhism.

6. **Analogy from the Dhammasangani Commentary:**
   - **Tax Collection Analogy:** Just as a king collects taxes based on individuals' functions (e.g., property owner, worker), the Abhidharma classifies factors based on their functional roles in different contexts.

**Metaphors, Similes, and Sutras Referenced**

- **Metaphors and Similes:**
  - **Tax Collection Analogy from the Dhammasangani Commentary:**
    - **Explanation:** The analogy compares the classification of factors in the Abhidharma to a king collecting taxes based on the functions or roles of his subjects rather than their identities as individuals.
    - **Significance:** Illustrates that factors may appear in multiple categories due to their different functions, emphasizing the importance of functional over essentialist classification.

- **Sutras and Texts Referenced:**
  - **Dhammasangani (Classification of Factors):**
    - **Context:** One of the seven books of the Abhidharma Pitaka, focusing on the detailed enumeration and classification of mental and physical phenomena.
    - **Relevance:** Provides the foundational structure for the Abhidharma's analytical approach to consciousness and experience.

- **Commentaries and Historical References:**
  - **Early Abhidharma Critiques:**
    - **Mention of Critics:** Acknowledges that even in the early development of the Abhidharma, there were misunderstandings about its functional classifications.
    - **Response:** Emphasizes the necessity of understanding factors based on their contextual functions to avoid confusion.

**Conclusion**

Chapter Thirty-Three underscores the intricate systems the Abhidharma employs to analyze consciousness, highlighting the importance of understanding both the objects of consciousness and the nature of consciousness itself. By examining the classifications and emphasizing the functional and contextual use of terms, the chapter guides readers toward a deeper comprehension of the phenomenological approach in Buddhism. This understanding is crucial for practitioners aiming to alleviate suffering by transforming their consciousness through insight into its true nature.
